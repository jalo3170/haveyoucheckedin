# Have you checked in? Random prompt app

https://haveyoucheckedin.netlify.app

This is a micro-application built for the OLES2107 course at USYD, for Assignment 2 - Social Media Project.

The idea is that social media content or even real life posters, flyers, or stickers could link to this micro-app via a QR code, and the user could get a quick prompt or reminder to check in with their loved ones.

More information can be found in the Social Media Engagement Strategy document.
